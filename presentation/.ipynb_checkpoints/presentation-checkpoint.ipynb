    "- classify **every** incoming packet to *DoS* or *benign*\n",

Results are impressive, in both cases with 99+% accuracy;\n",
    "  + [Paper#2a](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339907177_DDoS_attack_detection_and_classification_via_Convolutional_Neural_Network_CNN) similar to *Paper#1a*, but using a single bit as pixel (images now in black and white). In this case accuracy is slightly lower (always above 99% anyways). Furthermore, the model is larger compared to the smallest model presented in *Paper#1a* (that is also more accurate). This paper compares results with other ML approaches (e.g. SVM) and shows that already simple DL methods implemented are far superior;\n",
    "- classify **aggregated data of a flow** (flow = multiple packets) in the two classes already mentioned\n",
    "  + [Paper#1b](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rayalizing1/binary-classification-using-smote-lstm) using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE - the implementation of SMOTE and the functioning presented originally [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813)) and LSTMs. This is useful when dealing with unbalanced learning: instead of classical oversampling, new \"synthetic\" samples are generated introducing noise or averaging the already existing samples;\n",
    "  + [Paper#2b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9398712/) using Graph Attention Networks and extremely recent (16th Aug 2022). View traffic flows as a graph with metrics on the edges that represent the communication flow, then apply GNNs;\n",
    "  + [Paper#3b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-021-06608-1) that compares different ML approaches and draws current state of DoS detection techniques providing also numerous datasets to use for the task;\n",
    "  + [Paper#4b](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/14/8/240) makes use of autoencoders, I tried them in one of my attempts and produced very good (state of the art) results with an extremely simple model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Given the information presented, I decided to go with the second approach: WHY?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model I am going to produce should be able to work online at line rate, not on packet dumps offline (see Small Project in Cybersecurity results when ready). This means it should be as lightweight as possible to not kill packets troughput. Using the first approach would cause an evaluation of the model at every packet: this is too much e.g. in a router.\n",
    "- Managing flow information is much easier: million of packets can be \"compressed\" and organized into 80 features without keeping them saved in memory (especially, I can drop the content of the packet entirely). When a packet arrives, I am going to update only counters, means, variances, ... This can be done efficiently with one-pass algorithms.\n",
    "- The downside is that, in order to use the model in a real world scenario, I need first to aggregate some (many) packets to compute meaningful features values and only then, apply the model. With the other approach I could immediately distinguish a packet as DoS or non-DoS.\n"
