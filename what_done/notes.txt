- simple and small mlp model on multiclass no convergence huge loss
    - eperimented with full relu, full tanh, mixed decreased less loss but huge anyway
- simple and small mlp model on binary huge loss
    - more complex mlp model no convergence
    - anova with same model big loss but >97 accuracy
    - autoencoder same model comparable to anova
    - added scheduler and early stopping best model accuracy >99.8
    - refactoring of the code
-back to multiclass problem
    - anova no good
    - AE no good
    - all that worked for binary in multiclass works? yes high loss but acceptable result
