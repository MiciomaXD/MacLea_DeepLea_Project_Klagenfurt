___



The proposal *must* include at least the following five sections:

1. **Motivation**: why are you doing your project (personal motivation)? what is the goal of your application? why is it important? what is your hypothesis - an explanation of why your problem is solvable?)
2. **Learning task**
   - *Training experience*: where is your training experience coming from? why do you think that your data can actually be used to solve the problem? Provide examples of your data and use them to explain your learning task.
   - *Learning task:* what are you going to do?
   - *Performance measure*: how are you going to measure your success? which measures will be used and why? how can results returned by your measures be interpreted in the context of your problem, e.g. precision=0.7 is it good or bad?
3. **Plan**: how are you going to solve the learning task? No details are required, just a description of a general approach
4. **Related work**: provide a summary of at least one paper on scholar.google.com, blog, article, etc. that considers a problem similar to yours. how can you apply the suggested approach to solve your problem? what modifications might be required? can you use the suggested approach as a baseline in your evaluation?)
5. **Risk management**: what is your "plan B" in case something goes not as expected, e.g., no data, bad-quality data, non-converging ML algorithms, etc.
