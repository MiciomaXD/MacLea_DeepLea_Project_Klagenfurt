## Motivation
Internet and its infrastructure, from its birth, has granted almost endless possibilities in the realm of computing being one of the most important inventions of humankind: it is in fact, a powerful tool that potentially everyone can use at a fairly low price and effort. With the passing of time, many more devices were connected to the Net, in particular with the boom of IoT. Many of them serve also in critical tasks and it is crucial that they are reliable and always accessible by teir owner.
It is also true that with so many machines connected, a consistent part is vulnerable to cyberattacks that are growing in frequency and intensity, because of the valuable information/services stored or provided by computers.
If for intrusion detection, exploits and misconfiguration of such devices there are easy and applicable solutions (stronger crypto algorithms and passwords, firewalls, keep systems up-to-date, utilizing only trusted software, ...), for DoS and DDoS attacks there are not.
This kind of attacks are the most common on the Net infrastructure, but there is not a public-domain definitive solution that anyone could implement: this is mainly because they are diverse and because only an early detection and mitigation is possible.
(D)DoS attacks work either by:
+ flooding a victim of intense, bogus, ad hoc forged traffic, so that after some time it is unable to keep up with the requests degrading the performance also for legitimate requests OR
+ by exploiting inherent vulnerabilities of protocols, for example traffic congestion management of TCP/IP protocol done with time-windows and time-outs.

___

The proposal *must* include at least the following five sections:

1. **Motivation**: why are you doing your project (personal motivation)? what is the goal of your application? why is it important? what is your hypothesis - an explanation of why your problem is solvable?)
2. **Learning task**
   - *Training experience*: where is your training experience coming from? why do you think that your data can actually be used to solve the problem? Provide examples of your data and use them to explain your learning task.
   - *Learning task:* what are you going to do?
   - *Performance measure*: how are you going to measure your success? which measures will be used and why? how can results returned by your measures be interpreted in the context of your problem, e.g. precision=0.7 is it good or bad?
3. **Plan**: how are you going to solve the learning task? No details are required, just a description of a general approach
4. **Related work**: provide a summary of at least one paper on scholar.google.com, blog, article, etc. that considers a problem similar to yours. how can you apply the suggested approach to solve your problem? what modifications might be required? can you use the suggested approach as a baseline in your evaluation?)
5. **Risk management**: what is your "plan B" in case something goes not as expected, e.g., no data, bad-quality data, non-converging ML algorithms, etc.
